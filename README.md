<summary>More About Me!(click to expand)</summary>
<p align="left">  
<strong> For the last year and a half, thanks to Lambda School's part time full stack web dev program, I have been pouring my heart and soul into learning how to code. I chose the full stack web development route because I believe in understanding a product from front to back, and because my brain doesn't allow me to only understand half of a thing! It's much easier to sell a whole thing as opposed to a half of a thing!
